    <h3 class="header">Summary</h3>
    <p class="text">Hi, My name is Alexander and I have a passion for anything tech or art related. I've most recently started rigorously studying full stack programming and will eventually work my way to software development/design. So far I've learned basic HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript as well as Bootstrap. I'm a critical thinker who does well under pressure and welcomes any new challenges thrown my way. 
<br>
<br>
        I love to learn and collaborate with other creatives to overcome and create things we wouldn't be able to create on our own. However I do realize that learning these things and doing them are 2 different things which is why I'm searching for internships/apprenticeships. I'm excited to have the chance to work in a development environment and put everything I've learned to work!</p>
