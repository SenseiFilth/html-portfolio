    <h3 class="header">Summary</h3>
    <p class="text">Hi, My name is Alexander and  I'm a creative with a passion for technology and art. Currently, I am rigorously studying full-stack programming with the goal of specializing in software development and design. I currently have proficiency in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, as well as Database Maintenance in Access. I'm a critical thinker who does well under pressure and welcomes any new challenges thrown my way. 
<br>
<br>
        I love to learn and collaborate with other creatives to overcome and create things which is why I'm searching for internships/employment opportunities. I'm excited to have the opportunity to work in an environment where I can put everything I've learned to work!</p>
